    In 1991 Los Angeles, slacker Jeff "the Dude" Lebowski is assaulted in his home by two hired goons who demand money that the wife of a Jeffrey Lebowski owes to a porn magnate and loan shark named Jackie Treehorn. The two soon realize they have attacked the wrong Jeffrey Lebowski and leave but not before one of them urinates on the Dude's rug.
