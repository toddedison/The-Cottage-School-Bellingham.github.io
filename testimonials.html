	 <h3>What Parents Say</h3>



<p>"When the time came to find a kindergarten for our daughter last year, I researched several programs in Bellingham before finding The Cottage School. We were drawn to The Cottage School for many reasons.  We talked to several families whose children attended there and heard only extremely positive recommendations. The schedule too met our needs. I loved the alternate Friday on/Friday off, the fact that the day extended until 2:30 for Kindergartners."<br><a href="javascript:popUp(&#39;/letters/ltr10.html&#39;)">Read More</a></p><br>

<p>"I am writing this letter on behalf of Allison and Amy at The Cottage School. Our son Cody has attended The Cottage School during this past school year and absolutely loves it. My husband and I were interested in finding a preschool which would foster Cody's independence and positive self-image. The Cottage School has certainly done this and so much more..."<br>

<p>"The Cottage School is one of the best preschools in Bellingham.  Before my partner and I chose The Cottage School, I visited 32 non-religious preschools in Bellingham (every one!) and after assessing these schools in about 10 different categories (teacher quality, program quality, environment, safety, cleanliness, neighborhood, special programs, meals...) we felt The Cottage School was the best for our son."<br><a href="javascript:popUp(&#39;letters/ltr4.html&#39;)">Read More</a>

<p>"The Cottage School to me is a place where I feel confident that my children are safe, talked to and listened to with respect and encouragement.  They are being given an outlet to learn and grow in numerous ways and they are getting an education that inspires personal integrity and confidence.  This school is a place where there is creative expression and exploration. The teachers encourage their students to create personal values and positive communication skills..."<br><a href="javascript:popUp(&#39;letters/ltr8.html&#39;)">Read More</a>

<p>"Like most parents, we have strong opinions about what sort of environment we want for our child. Both my ex-wife and I have worked as preschool teachers. I also have a Ph.D. in developmental psychology and teach child development at Western Washington University, where many of my students are preparing to be early childhood educators. I have worked with many different preschools including one of the best in the country (Bing Nursery School at Stanford University), so I have some perspective and expertise to evaluate early childhood education environments..." <br><a href="javascript:popUp(&#39;letters/ltr1.html&#39;)">Read More</a></p>
