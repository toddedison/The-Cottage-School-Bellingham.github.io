When the time came to find a kindergarten for our daughter last year, I researched several programsin Bellingham before finding The Cottage School. We were drawn to The Cottage School for many reasons. We talked to several families whose children attended there and heard only extremely positive recommendations. The schedule too met our needs. I loved the alternate Friday on/Friday off, the fact that the day extended until 2:30 for Kindergartners.

Most important to us was finding a place that is child-centered and directed. We wanted an environment that nurtures the natural development of children while nurturing self-responsibility and expression. When we toured the school, I knew this was a very special place. The timber frame of the cottage, heated cork floors, lovely windows that look out to the play yard felt warm, cozy and inviting. The setting felt peaceful, calm and stimulating.

Books and art, games and places for imaginary play exist in lovely spaces throughout this warm cottage environment. The natural surroundings were also important to us both in the cottage, as well as in the safe and fenced yard where the children play.

After speaking with Amy and Allison and visiting the school, there was no doubt we’d found the place for this next stage of our daughter’s education.

As teachers and directors, Amy and Allison are completely dedicated to their practice, curriculum and mission. This is evident in meeting each of them and watching them engage with the children and families. You feel their focus, integrity and passion each day you walk in the door. There is a peace, consistency and calm upon entering the schoolhouse and a warmth that you feel. I know as I say goodbye to my daughter in the morning, I am leaving her in a safe place full of opportunity at every turn.

I appreciate Amy and Allison for their clear and direct approach in communication. The balance they provide in personality is a wonderful gift to the children. There is a clear sense of consistency in their teaching practice so children and families know what is expected. They are each in their individual approach incredibly nurturing, fun and loving.

Amy and Allison are dedicated to knowing and understanding each child. The small class size makes this possible and was clearly one very big reason we chose The Cottage School.

The curriculum involves the whole child. Art, science, nature, math, reading, stories and song are a part of the day. When the day is done, and I pick up my daughter, I know the day was full and fun and challenging in the best sense.

Because of the small class size, the children have opportunity to take numerous field trips around town. They walk to enjoy nature or breakfast or tea or to visit the local library. They have the chance to take the bus to outings at the theatre and see local art.

Another wonderful piece of the curriculum is weekly swim lessons at the YMCA. Our daughter loves to swim and enjoys the bus ride to the YMCA and the time she has had to develop her swimming skills even further. I am continually impressed with what she has learned from Amy and Allison in the pool.

A wholesome, organic snack is provided each day consistent with how we eat as a family. There is plenty of choice. Respect is valued for the food and practice of sitting at a meal together.

Amy and Allison truly are dedicated to the well being of each child. They believe in each child’s capabilities and make that known. Friendship, respect, kindness and caring are highly valued at The Cottage School. These principles are taught through role-playing, puppetry and are a core part of the school environment. You can see children genuinely care about one another.

Honesty, integrity and tolerance are values taught as part of the emotional development curriculum. Children learn to express themselves: their feelings, thoughts and needs. Amy and Allison truly model being present and mindful in their communication and interaction with the children.

Now nearing the end of my daughter’s kindergarten year, we feel deep gratitude for choosing The Cottage School. Amy and Allison have fostered a tremendous foundation in our daughter for her continued learning. We have seen beautiful strides in her whole development: emotionally, physically and mentally. She is more confident, sure of herself, aware of her relationships. She is reading and writing, working with math in new directions and making connections emotionally and intellectually. Every evening at dinner, she has a story to share about her day and what she learned through friendship and academics.

Amy and Allison are outstanding in their leadership and teaching practice. I recommend wholeheartedly The Cottage School to anyone looking for a structured, nurturing, loving and joyful environment focused on the core principles of play, arts and academics.
