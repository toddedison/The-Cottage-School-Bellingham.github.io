  create and learn about themselves and their world. 
  At The Cottage School, we cherish the individual and nurture the whole child.</p>

  <p>We practice honoring ourselves 
  and our place on the earth. We use the world around us to enhance our process-oriented 
  curriculum which includes art, science, 
  language arts, singing/movement, 
  mathematical solving, outdoor exploration 
  and weekly swimming lessons. </p>
<p>All learning is group based and individually paced. The focus on acadamia is 
  a gentle, yet ever present infusion in our daily routines. Children who stay with us thru Kindergarten leave The Cottage School ready to enter any public or 
  private school with confidence in themselves and their abilities both socially
  and academically.
